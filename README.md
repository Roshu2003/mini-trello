# Taskify (Trello)
Project Overview
================

The project is a **collaborative task and project management platform** inspired by tools like Trello. It is built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** and provides an intuitive interface for teams to organize projects into **workspaces, boards, lists, and cards**.

The platform incorporates essential productivity features such as **card management, labels, assignees, search, and workspaces**, making it a versatile tool for individuals and organizations to manage tasks efficiently.

Workspace & Board Management
----------------------------

*   Users can create multiple **workspaces** to represent teams or departments.
    
*   Each workspace can contain multiple **boards** that represent projects.
    
*   Boards have customizable **backgrounds (color or image)** for better visual organization.
    
*   Boards can be **deleted** or **updated** dynamically, with changes reflected instantly in the UI.
    

Card Management
---------------

*   Boards contain **lists**, and lists hold **cards**.
    
*   Cards represent tasks and support features such as:
    
    *   **Labels** (e.g., bug, feature, urgent)
        
    *   **Assignees** (users assigned to tasks)
        
    *   **Due dates** and **descriptions**
        
*   Cards can be **created, updated, searched, and deleted** easily.
    
*   A dedicated **Card component** improves reusability across the platform.
    

Search Functionality
--------------------

The platform includes a **search system** to quickly find cards within a board by:

*   **Title**
    
*   **Labels**
    
*   **Assignees**


Authentication & Authorization
------------------------------

*   The platform uses **JWT-based authentication** to secure endpoints.
    
*   **Role-based access control** ensures that only authorized users can:
    
    *   Create or delete boards
        
    *   Manage workspaces
        
    *   Update cards and lists
        
*   Context-aware validation can be added for more secure user handling.
    

User Roles
----------

There are three key user roles within the system:

1.  **Admin** ‚Äì Manages workspaces, boards, and oversees overall usage.
    
2.  **Members** ‚Äì Can create/update/delete cards within workspaces they belong to.
    
3.  **Viewers** ‚Äì Limited role with read-only access to boards and cards.
